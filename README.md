# GSheet-DDNS-Checker

In a Google sheet this script will read column A where the ddns are and read column c, d, e, f, g where the ports are. 
Once Nmap shows if up/down it will show the device that's under a port in a comments and change the colors of the cell.

Video for the dumbis 

Add 2 new col of ports in sheet. At least a explnachion. 

Add note of ISP in col 1,2

If isp is not empty then change color (Avoiding force online from NMap using -Pn)

Evenchally index.js will go into cell instead of notes. (at least index_cell.js index_note.js

ISP - should be strip to ISP Name. on new cell (For my persnal app)
